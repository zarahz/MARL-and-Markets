\chapter{Discussion}\label{sec:Discussion}
- Are the findings as expected? \\
- Why are the things as they were observed? \\
- New experiments that provide further insights \\
- Make your results more comprehensible

- challenges of markets (i.e. agents didn't need to sell shares/buy actions)

- final reward is not necessary easy to interpret (did agent do good actions or did he just pick good market actions that sold)?

- maybe markets need to be more specific (let agents know what others want to buy before choosing action!) and less based on chance
- and/or more dynamic, i.e. instead of fixed prices agents can decide what to pay for actions/shares, so that they can for them self decide how important the trade is, and in case of shareholder market, maybe enable multi share purchase?
