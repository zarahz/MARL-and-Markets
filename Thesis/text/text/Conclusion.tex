Cooperation may reward misbehavior, namely field resetting, leading to the CAP of Chapter \ref{CAP}. In mixed-motive or fully competitive settings the overall goal may be never reached due to greediness or disorder. This research further compares the effects of markets not only on competitive settings as suggested by Schmid et al. \cite{scbe21}, but rather on all three configurations.
